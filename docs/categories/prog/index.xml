      <title>runp: run shell commands in parallel</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m using shell (bash specifically) on daily basis. From time to time a need arises to run multiple commands in parallel. For example my .bashrc runs commands like these to download or clone vim plugins I use:
curl -L -o $HOME/.git-completion.bash https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash rm -rf $HOME/.vim/pack/plugins/start/grep.vim &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git clone https://github.com/yegappan/grep.git $HOME/.vim/pack/plugins/start/grep.vim # https://tpaschalis.github.io/vim-go-setup/ rm -rf $HOME/.vim/pack/plugins/start/vim-go &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git clone https://github.com/fatih/vim-go.git $HOME/.vim/pack/plugins/start/vim-go The problem is that these commmands run sequentially and it takes a while until they are done.</description>

      <description>Types Go is statically typed - variables always have specific type and type cannot change during the program run time.
Types help us reason about what our program is doing and help us catch many errors.
Types are similar to sets in mathematics. They classify data into groups and determine:
 characteristics of data (e.g. all strings have length) operations that can be performed on data (e.g. len(&amp;quot;a string&amp;quot;)) data size (e.</description>

      <title>TCP sockets with Go</title>

      <description>Client This is an HTTP client implemented using socket-level programming:
// Usage: go run telnet.go package main import ( &amp;#34;bufio&amp;#34; &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; &amp;#34;net&amp;#34; ) func main() { // NOTE: ignoring errors by storing them into _  conn, _ := net.Dial(&amp;#34;tcp&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;golang.org:80&amp;#34;) // Connect over TCP  fmt.Fprintf(conn, &amp;#34;GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n&amp;#34;) // Send string over the connection  status, _ := bufio.NewReader(conn).ReadString(&amp;#39;\n&amp;#39;) fmt.Print(status) // Print the first response line } To add a timeout you can use the Dialer structure (I&amp;rsquo;ve also added error checking + reading from command line arguments):</description>

      <title>Perl one-liners</title>

      <description>Introduction to Perl one-liners I think Perl one-liners are still super useful. They are small Perl programs that are run directly from command line. Like this one from the Kubernetes job documentation:
perl -Mbignum=bpi -wle &amp;#34;print bpi(2000)&amp;#34; perl is the Perl language interpreter. -M and -wle are command line switches (or options) that modify the perl&#39;s behaviour. See below for explanation of what they mean. The string within double quotes is the Perl code that gets executed.</description>

      <description>How to write tests for a Perl script At $work, I was to upgrade several Debians from Squeezy through Wheezy to Jessie (6 to 8). I wanted to be sure that after the upgrade (mostly) the same processes are running as before. I whipped up a script, that simply stores the list of running processes before the upgrade. When run subsequently it reports missing processes (if any).
To make the script reliable and easy to maintain I wanted to test it somehow.</description>
